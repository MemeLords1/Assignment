# Spotify Combine List


The project or Assignment I was task to do was to make a program that reads in Multiple CSV Files and sort them base on what the person wanted in this example it was to sort them base off of the Song Name.

# Installation

For the code to work, all it does is read in the information in week1,week2,week3,weekn CSV File and copy them into a singler main file called SpotifyQuarterList . If you want to use this Programe all you need to do is input the information or spotify list into the week1,week2,week3,weekn or delete the weeks you dont want and just run the programe. The SpotifyQuarterList would automatically update the information you have changed in week1,week2,week3,weekn and example would be if you delete everything in week1 file or change some songs inside of it and run the programe the programe itself would update the SpotifyQuarterList.csv file itself.
