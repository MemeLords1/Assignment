# Spotify Top 200 Song Sort


The project or Assignment i was task to do was to make a program that reads in CSV Files and sort them base on what the person wanted in this example it was to used to sort the names of all the artist on the spotify list

# Installation

For the code to work I manually set it so that it would only read the SpotifyList.CSV that is attaced to the folder also. If you want to use this Programe for something beside the designated CSV file that I have implemented In the Main.java you can just change the 
CSV_PATH to any CSV file you are trying to run.
