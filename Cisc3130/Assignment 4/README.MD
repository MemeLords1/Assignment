# Movie Genre Assignment 4


The project or Assignment I was task to do was to see which movie genres are available out there, in order to know which categories of movies to have at his online storefront. In order to do so we needs to know more about movies produced and has a copy of data from the grouplens.

# Installation

For the code to work, all you need to do is run Main.java and this will read the moives.CSV file which you have downloaded from grouplens.org the permalink is https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/.
Once you have the Movies List and the program just run Main.java and this will print the outcome/report onto the console and will also print it into seperate CSV file called Number of Movies created by Years.csv,Number of Genre of Movies Created within the last five Years.csv, and Movies Sorted by Genre.csv which is the same data as the one printed on the console but just in a CSV file so it can be stored and used later without running the program all over again. 

## Dependencies 

## Setup

1) Sign up for a GitHub account if you don't have one. Set up your SSH keys with github.
2) Clone this repository git clone Cisc3130/Assignment 4 to your machine to get a copy. Or just download it from the website itself
3) Move into the project's root directory with cd assignment
4) Compile the java file using the java compiler command javac Main.java
5) Run the compiled java program with the java command java Main

## Notes: 
You Should See three differnet CSV File and on the console it should also print the report.
The three CSV file are
1)Movies Sorted by Genre.csv
2)Number of Genre of Movies Created within the last five Years.csv
3)Number of Movies created by Years.csv 

The console print the report for people who are just trying to see the information or result quickly by just running the program but for people who are trying to store the data and trying to look at it without having to run the program all over again I had the data printed onto different CSV file so it could be quickly accessed and stored for later use.
